The adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows an object with an incompatible interface to be used as if it had the interface required by a client. It does this by wrapping the incompatible object in an adapter class, which translates the client's calls into calls that the incompatible object can understand.

The adapter pattern is useful when you have an existing class that you cannot modify, but you need to use it in a new context that requires a different interface. By using an adapter, you can reuse the existing class without modifying it, and you can make it work with the new context.

The adapter pattern has four main components:

Target: This is the interface that the client expects the adapted object to implement.
Client: This is the object that depends on the target interface.
Adaptee: This is the existing class that has an incompatible interface.
Adapter: This is the adapter class that wraps the adaptee and implements the target interface. It translates the calls from the client into calls that the adaptee can understand.
`

package main

import "fmt"

// Target is an interface for the target object.
type Target interface {
	Request()
}

// Adaptee is a struct with an incompatible interface.
type Adaptee struct{}

// SpecificRequest is the incompatible method of Adaptee.
func (a *Adaptee) SpecificRequest() {
	fmt.Println("SpecificRequest from Adaptee")
}

// Adapter is a struct that adapts the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface.
type Adapter struct {
	adaptee *Adaptee
}

// Request is the method of the Target interface.
// It calls the SpecificRequest method of the Adaptee.
func (a *Adapter) Request() {
	a.adaptee.SpecificRequest()
}



`
In this example, the Target interface defines an interface for the target object, and the Adaptee struct has an incompatible interface. The Adapter struct adapts the interface of the Adaptee struct to the Target interface, and the Request method of the Adapter struct calls the SpecificRequest method of the Adaptee struct.
This pattern allows the outer layer to use the inner layer (Adaptee) without knowing its concrete implementation, and without modifying the inner layer. This separation of concerns allows for more maintainable and testable code, as the inner layer can be tested in isolation from the outer layer.
