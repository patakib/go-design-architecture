`
The singleton pattern is a creational pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.
`

package main

import "fmt"

// Singleton is a class that implements the singleton pattern.
type Singleton struct{}

// instance is the singleton instance.
var instance *Singleton

// GetInstance returns the singleton instance.
func GetInstance() *Singleton {
	if instance == nil {
		instance = &Singleton{}
	}
	return instance
}

func main() {
	s1 := GetInstance()
	s2 := GetInstance()

	if s1 == s2 {
		fmt.Println("s1 and s2 are the same instance")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("s1 and s2 are different instances")
	}
}



`
In this example, the main function depends on the inner layer (Singleton) to get the singleton instance. The GetInstance function ensures that only one instance of the Singleton struct is created, and it returns the same instance every time it is called.

This pattern can be useful when you want to ensure that a class has only one instance, and you want to provide a global access point to that instance. However, it can make it difficult to test the code that depends on the singleton, as the singleton instance cannot be replaced with a mock object during testing.
