The factory pattern is a creational pattern that defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
`


package main

import "fmt"

// Product is an interface for products.
type Product interface {
	Use()
}

// ConcreteProductA is a concrete implementation of Product.
type ConcreteProductA struct{}

// Use uses the product.
func (p *ConcreteProductA) Use() {
	fmt.Println("Using ConcreteProductA")
}

// ConcreteProductB is a concrete implementation of Product.
type ConcreteProductB struct{}

// Use uses the product.
func (p *ConcreteProductB) Use() {
	fmt.Println("Using ConcreteProductB")
}

// Factory is an interface for factories.
type Factory interface {
	Create() Product
}

// ConcreteFactoryA is a concrete implementation of Factory that creates ConcreteProductA objects.
type ConcreteFactoryA struct{}

// Create creates a ConcreteProductA object.
func (f *ConcreteFactoryA) Create() Product {
	return &ConcreteProductA{}
}

// ConcreteFactoryB is a concrete implementation of Factory that creates ConcreteProductB objects.
type ConcreteFactoryB struct{}

// Create creates a ConcreteProductB object.
func (f *ConcreteFactoryB) Create() Product {
	return &ConcreteProductB{}
}

func main() {
	factoryA := &ConcreteFactoryA{}
	productA := factoryA.Create()
	productA.Use()

	factoryB := &ConcreteFactoryB{}
	productB := factoryB.Create()
	productB.Use()
}

  
`
In this example, the Product interface and the ConcreteProductA and ConcreteProductB structs form the application's inner layer, while the Factory interface and the ConcreteFactoryA and ConcreteFactoryB structs are part of the infrastructure layer. The main function is the outer layer, and it depends on the inner layer (Product) to use the product.

The Factory interface defines an interface for creating Product objects, but allows subclasses (i.e., ConcreteFactoryA and ConcreteFactoryB) to alter the type of Product objects that will be created. This allows the application to create different types of Product objects without knowing their concrete implementation.

This separation of concerns allows for more maintainable and testable code, as the inner layer can be tested in isolation from the infrastructure layer. It also makes it easier to create different types of Product objects without affecting the inner layer.
