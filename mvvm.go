`
MVVM is a variant of MVC that separates the application into a model, a view, and a view model. The view model is a layer between the view and the model that exposes data and functionality to the view and handles user input from the view.
`

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

// Model represents the data and business logic of the application.
type Model struct {
	ID   int
	Name string
}

// ViewModel is a layer between the view and the model that exposes data and functionality to the view and handles user input from the view.
type ViewModel struct {
	model *Model
}

// GetName returns the name of the model.
func (vm *ViewModel) GetName() string {
	return vm.model.Name
}

// SetName updates the name of the model.
func (vm *ViewModel) SetName(name string) {
	vm.model.Name = name
}

// View is responsible for rendering the user interface.
type View struct {
	viewModel *ViewModel
}

// Render displays the view model to the user.
func (v *View) Render() {
	fmt.Println("Name:", v.viewModel.GetName())
}

func main() {
	model := &Model{ID: 123, Name: "My Entity"}
	viewModel := &ViewModel{model: model}
	view := &View{viewModel: viewModel}

	if err := view.Render(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	if err := viewModel.SetName("New Name"); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	if err := view.Render(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}


`
In this example, the Model, ViewModel, and View structs form the application's inner layer. The ViewModel struct is a layer between the View struct and the Model struct that exposes data and functionality to the View struct and handles user input from the View struct. The main function is the outer layer, and it depends on the inner layer (View) to display the user interface and handle user input.

This separation of concerns allows for more maintainable and testable code, as the inner layer can be tested in isolation from the outer layer. It also makes it easier to modify the user interface without affecting the business logic.
