`
MVC is a pattern that separates the application into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller. The model represents the data and business logic of the application, the view is responsible for rendering the user interface, and the controller handles user input and updates the model and view as needed.
`

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

// Model represents the data and business logic of the application.
type Model struct {
	ID   int
	Name string
}

// View is responsible for rendering the user interface.
type View struct{}

// Render displays the model to the user.
func (v *View) Render(model *Model) {
	fmt.Println("ID:", model.ID)
	fmt.Println("Name:", model.Name)
}

// Controller handles user input and updates the model and view as needed.
type Controller struct {
	model *Model
	view  *View
}

// HandleInput processes user input and updates the model and view as needed.
func (c *Controller) HandleInput(input string) {
	c.model.Name = input
	c.view.Render(c.model)
}

func main() {
	model := &Model{ID: 123, Name: "My Entity"}
	view := &View{}
	controller := &Controller{model: model, view: view}

	if err := controller.HandleInput("New Name"); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
